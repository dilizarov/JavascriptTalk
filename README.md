#Javascript

##What is Javascript?

Javascript is the language used for client-side logic. What does this mean?

1. The code is on the user's computer.
2. You could make great effects.
3. You're a few steps away from cutting-edge awesomeness (well, technically, you're already there).

##A quick introduction

    //variable declaration
    var goodPractice = "Hi, I'm a string";
    badPractice = "You don't want to do this";
    
Many texts lie and say you must use `var` to declare a variable. That's not true. What's true is you should. In the above, `var goodPractice` makes a **local** variable. `badPractice` is a **global** variable. There are very few cases where you would make a global variable. 

1. Represent the logged-in user in your application.
2. The elegance of your code is lost in you passing some variable everywhere.
